## Usage

The usage of this workflow is described in the [Snakemake Workflow Catalog](https://snakemake.github.io/snakemake-workflow-catalog/?usage=pangenome%2Fphage-evo-paper).

# TODO

* Replace `pangenome` and `phage-evo-paper` everywhere in the template (also under .github/workflows) with the correct `phage-evo-paper` name and owning user or organization.
* The workflow will occur in the snakemake-workflow-catalog once it has been made public. Then the link under "Usage" will point to the usage instructions if `pangenome` and `phage-evo-paper` were correctly set.
